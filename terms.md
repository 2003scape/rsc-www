## Online games

### Single Player Games
These require no registration or subscription to access and play.

### Multiplayer Games
These require no subscription, but do require you to choose a Username and a Password to access and play.

### RuneScape
There are two versions of RuneScape, a Free Version which requires no subscription but does require you to choose a Username and a Password to access and play, and a Members Version which is Subscription-based. Your use of RuneScape is also subject to our Rules of Conduct.

## Your responsibilities

### Username
You must not choose a Username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff of other users, or which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene or otherwise unlawful. We reserve the right to change any Username for any reason.

### Password
You agree to keep your Password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You must ensure that your computer is kept free of viruses and Trojans to ensure the safety of your password. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your current password.

### Sign-Up
By signing-up for an account you are opting-in to allow us to store personal information, cookies, etc. as described in our Privacy Policy.

### Chat facility
When using the chat facility you must not use any language which may be considered by others to be offensive, racist or obscene, or otherwise infringes the rights of third parties.

If you are the victim of the sort of behaviour described above, or receive any other unwanted communications you must use the built in facilities to block the messages. If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further messages (to do this point at the friends menu, click on the 'ignore' tab, click where it says 'click here to add a name' and enter the name of the user to block). If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players you must use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your friends (to do this point at the configuration menu, and ensure all four privacy settings are switched to 'on').
