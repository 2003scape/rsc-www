## Online games

*Single Player Games*
These require no registration or subscription to access and play.

*Multiplayer Games*
These require no subscription, but do require you to choose a Username and a Password to access and play.

*RuneScape*
There are two versions of RuneScape, a Free Version which requires no subscription but does require you to choose a Username and a Password to access and play, and a Members Version which is Subscription-based. Your use of RuneScape is also subject to our Rules of Conduct.

## Your responsibilities

*Username*
You must not choose a Username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff of other users, or which is deliberately confusing or which is offensive, racist, obscene or otherwise unlawful. We reserve the right to change any Username for any reason.

*Password*
You agree to keep your Password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You must ensure that your computer is kept free of viruses and Trojans to ensure the safety of your password. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your current password.

*RuneScape Account*
You agree that your RuneScape character and account and items are and remain the property of Jagex. You may not sell, transfer or lend your account to anyone else, or permit anyone else to use your account, and you may not accept an account which anybody else offers you.

You may create more than one RuneScape account, but if you do, you may not log into more than one account at any time, and they must not interact with each other in any way. Using one account to drop objects for transfer to another of your accounts is not allowed.

We reserve the right to delete all your accounts, block your access to our website and services, and/or take further legal action if you violate any of these terms and conditions. We may delete or modify any account at any time for any reason.

*Sign-Up*
By signing-up for an account you are opting-in to allow us to store personal information, cookies, etc. as described in our Privacy Policy.

*Chat facility*
When using the chat facility you must not use any language which may be considered by others to be offensive, racist or obscene, or otherwise infringes the rights of third parties. You must not use the chat facility to harass, threaten, scam or deceive other players. You agree that the chat facility is only for role-playing in the game, and is not designed or intended to be used as a forum for other types of discussion.

You agree that for the purpose of preventing offensive language and cheating we may automatically or manually censor the chat as we see fit, and that we may record or monitor the chat to help us identify offenders. Sexually harassing, threatening, stalking or otherwise harassing others may result in legal action being taken against you.

If you are the victim of the sort of behaviour described above, or receive any other unwanted communications you must use the built in facilities to block the messages. If there is a particular user causing a problem then use the ignore function to block further messages (to do this point at the friends menu, click on the 'ignore' tab, click where it says 'click here to add a name' and enter the name of the user to block). If you continue to receive unwanted messages, or receive harassment from multiple players you must use the privacy controls to block all messages from everyone except your friends (to do this point at the configuration menu, and ensure all four privacy settings are switched to 'on'). If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied then you must stop using this web site.

You may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to logout inactive users automatically.
